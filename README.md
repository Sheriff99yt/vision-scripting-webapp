# Vision Visual Scripting Web App

This project is a private implementation of a visual scripting web app, providing users with a node-based interface for designing and connecting workflows. The app emphasizes a user-friendly, visually appealing UI with customizable dark and light modes.

## Features
- **Node-Based Design:** Easily create, edit, and link nodes to develop workflows.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Switch between dark and light modes for optimal viewing.
- **Local Save/Load Functionality:** Save and load scripts from local JSON files.
- **Customizable Nodes:** Input, process, and output nodes with clean designs and soft shadows.
- **Real-Time Node Management:** Drag and drop nodes to design workflows interactively.
- **Toolbox Search:** Search and add different node types with a simple interface.
- **Dynamic Ports:** Ensuring flexible port management for real-time connections.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, CSS (with Tailwind CSS support)
- **Backend:** Temporarily disabled (FastAPI planned for future development)
- **Data Storage:** JSON files for local saving and loading
- **Additional Tools:** WebSockets and AI integrations planned for future updates
